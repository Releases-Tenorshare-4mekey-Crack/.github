Tenorshare 4MeKey is a software tool designed to bypass or remove the Apple ID or iCloud account from an iPhone, iPad, or iPod. Itâ€™s commonly used when users forget their Apple ID password or purchase a secondhand device thatâ€™s locked to someone else's Apple ID. 4MeKey helps to unlock the device by removing the iCloud activation lock, allowing the user to regain full access to the device. However, itâ€™s important to note that using such software should be done responsibly and ethically, as bypassing iCloud locks without proper authorization may violate Apple's terms of service.
